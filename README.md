## Description
The game of Pig is a very simple jeopardy dice game in which two players race to reach 100 points.

At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions:

### Behavior Driven Development
Player 1 clicks ROLL button
Dice rolls and number is generated
If Player 1 rolls any number other than 1, that roll is added to round total
If Player 1 rolls a 1, no score is added and round for Player 1 ends
Player 2 begins,rolls any number other than 1, that roll is added to round total
If Player 2 rolls a 1, no score is added and the round for Player 2 ends and the cycle repeats
If a player chooses to "HOLD", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn
When a player's total score reaches 100 or more, game ends is the winner
